## Tips for creating your project website

- [ ] Find a name and create a logo preferably with a transparent background and export as .svg or .png
- [ ] Sketch or make a list of the main pages and the structure your website / application ([remember Shneiderman’s Mantra](http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2015/01/08/shneidermans_mantra.html))
- [ ] Write must-have textual content such as "About the project, Team, Contact, Publications, Downloads" etc. in a text editor of your choice.
- [ ] Think about creating some introductory content (spell out the abbreviations!) to show on the primary section of your home page (i.e hero area)
- [ ] Develop main functionality of your application with your favourite server side language and use only basic HTML and CSS for the user interface
- [ ] Download Fundament or Fundament-WP and create a new website instance
- [ ] Add your project's title, logo, hero area content and information pages
- [ ] Create separate pages for your application's views and integrate your application into the HTML body of Fundament
- [ ] Check out Fundament's example pages and Bootstrap-4 for which CSS classes to use and adapt your components
- [ ] Create and enqueue additional .css and .js files to overwrite / extend existing styles or functionality
