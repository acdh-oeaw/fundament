### Adding the JS
Copy-paste the following JS files at the end of your pages before closing the </body> tag. Remember that the first resource we're embedding is for the Fontawesome icons. If you're sure that you won't need any icons, then you don't need to copy the first line. However jQuery is required for many components. We use jQueryâ€™s slim build, but the full version is also supported.
